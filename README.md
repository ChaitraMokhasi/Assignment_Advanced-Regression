## Problem Statement
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Technologies Used
- Advanced Regression 
- Regularization tehcniques - Ridge and Lasso
- Programming language - Python 3.x
- Software - Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusions
R2 Score of Test data for Lasso regression is 0.864071 is slightly higher than the R2 Score of Test data for Redge regression , which is 0.862928.

Mean square error of Test data for Lasso regression is 0.048687 is slightly lower than the Mean square error of Test data for Redge regression , which is 0.048892.

Lasso regression model can predict the more accurate values for the sale price for house.
